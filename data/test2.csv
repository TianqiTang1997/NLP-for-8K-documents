2019-05-02,MMM,"Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On May 1, 2019, 3M Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Acelity L.P. Inc., a Guernsey limited partnership (“Seller”) and Acelity, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Seller (“Acelity”). The Stock Purchase Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the Company will acquire all of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of Acelity for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $4.4452 billion, subject to certain adjustments, plus a daily ticking fee from December 31, 2018 until the date the acquisition is completed. Inclusive of the assumption of debt, the transaction contemplates an enterprise value of approximately $6.725 billion.
 
Each party’s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement is subject to certain customary conditions, including (i) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, (ii) receipt of required approvals from governmental authorities or expiration of applicable waiting periods under antitrust laws outside of the United States, (iii) the absence of any order issued by any governmental authority enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and (iv) the absence of any law or order prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of such transactions. The Company’s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement is also conditioned on, among other things, the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement).
 
The Stock Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. Among other things, from the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement until the consummation of the transactions, Seller is required to cause Acelity and its subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and to comply with certain other covenants regarding the operation of their businesses. The Company and Seller have also agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all approvals from governmental authorities for the transaction, including all antitrust approvals, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
 
The Stock Purchase Agreement also contains certain rights to terminate the agreement, including the right of either the Company or Seller to terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement (i) on or after February 1, 2020, if the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement have not been consummated by such date (which date the Company may elect to extend to a date no later than May 1, 2020 if all conditions other than those pertaining to approvals required under applicable antitrust laws have been satisfied or waived), (ii) if an order issued by a governmental authority enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement becomes final and non-appealable, (iii) if a law prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement is enacted or (iv) in the event of certain uncured material breaches of the Stock Purchase Agreement by the other party or parties.
 
The foregoing description of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Stock Purchase Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Stock Purchase Agreement has been attached as an exhibit to this report in order to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, Seller, Acelity, or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specific dates as set forth therein; are solely for the benefit of the parties to the Stock Purchase Agreement; may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement; may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Stock Purchase Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties or covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, Seller, Acelity, or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by the Company.

Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: risks associated with the contemplated transactions generally, such as the inability to obtain, delays in obtaining, or the imposition of burdensome conditions imposed in connection with obtaining, required approvals under applicable antitrust legislation and other regulatory and third party consents and approvals; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted following announcement of the contemplated transactions; potential severe volatility in the capital markets and the impact on the cost to the Company to obtain debt financing as may be necessary to consummate the transactions; failure to retain key management and employees of Acelity and its subsidiaries; issues or delays in the successful integration of Acelity’s operations with those of the Company, including incurring or experiencing unanticipated costs and/or delays or difficulties, which could result in additional demands on the Company’s resources, systems, procedures and controls, disruption of its ongoing business and diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; difficulties or delays in the successful transition from the information technology systems of Acelity to those of the Company as well as risks associated with other integration or transition of the operations, systems and personnel of Acelity; failure or inability to implement growth strategies in a timely manner; unfavorable reactions to the contemplated transactions from customers, competitors, suppliers and employees; the possibility that certain assumptions with respect to Acelity’s business or the contemplated transactions could prove to be inaccurate; worldwide economic, political, regulatory, capital markets and other external conditions and other factors beyond the Company’s control, including natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; the Company’s credit ratings and its cost of capital; changes in tax and other laws, regulations, rates and policies; competitive conditions and customer preferences; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; the timing and market acceptance of new product offerings; the availability and cost of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) due to shortages, increased demand or supply interruptions (including those caused by natural and other disasters and other events); the impact of acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring; operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated; unanticipated problems or delays with the phased implementation of a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, or security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology infrastructure; financial market risks that may affect the Company’s funding obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement plans; and legal proceedings, including significant developments that could occur in the legal and regulatory proceedings described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2018, and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (the “Reports”). Changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results. A further description of these factors is located in the Reports under “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Items 1 and 1A (Annual Report) and in Part I, Item 2 and Part II, Item 1A (Quarterly Reports).

*Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the affirmative “FOR” vote of a majority of those shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to approve the stockholder proposal. In tabulating the voting result, abstentions and, if applicable, broker non-votes are not counted as votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” the proposal. An abstention will, however, be counted as entitled to vote on a proposal and will, therefore, have the effect of a vote “AGAINST.” Applying this standard, the percentage in favor of the stockholder proposal is calculated by dividing the number of FOR votes by the sum of the number of FOR, AGAINST and ABSTAIN votes.

This Current Report on Form 8-K includes supplemental unaudited historical business segment net sales and operating income information in addition to net sales on a disaggregated basis that reflect the realignment of 3M’s business segments effective in the second quarter of 2019 from five segments to four. The Company did not operate under this segment structure for any of these prior periods and will begin to report comparative results under the new structure with the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2019. 


 


This Current Report includes additional detail regarding this change along with supplemental unaudited historical information relative to business segment net sales and operating income on both an annual and quarterly basis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and on a quarterly basis for the period ended March 31, 2019 in addition to net sales on a disaggregated basis on an annual basis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 and on a quarterly basis for the periods ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (furnished hereunder as Exhibit 99 and incorporated herein by reference).


 


The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed to be “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be incorporated by reference into a filing under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Exchange Act.


 


Forward-Looking Statements


This Current Report contains forward-looking information about 3M’s financial results and estimates and business prospects that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “aim,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “target,” “forecast” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans or prospects. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: (1) worldwide economic, political, regulatory, capital markets and other external conditions and other factors beyond the Company’s control, including natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; (2) the Company’s credit ratings and its cost of capital; (3) competitive conditions and customer preferences; (4) foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; (5) the timing and market acceptance of new product offerings; (6) the availability and cost of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) due to shortages, increased demand or supply interruptions (including those caused by natural and other disasters and other events); (7) the impact of acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring; (8) operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated; (9) unanticipated problems or delays with the phased implementation of a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, or security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology infrastructure; (10) financial market risks that may affect the Company’s funding obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement plans; and (11) legal proceedings, including significant developments that could occur in the legal and regulatory proceedings described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2018, and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (the “Reports”). Changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results. A further description of these factors is located in the Reports under “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Items 1 and 1A (Annual Report) and in Part I, Item 2 and Part II, Item 1A (Quarterly Reports). The information contained in this Current Report is as of the date indicated. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this Current Report as a result of new information or future events or developments.

2019-06-11,MMM,"Item 7.01. Regulation FD
 
As previously disclosed in our SEC filings, 3M continually reviews factors and changes that could lead to a deconsolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiary, such as the ability to access various exchange mechanisms, the impact of government regulations on our ability to manage our subsidiary’s capital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations, and the current political and economic situation within the country.
 
In light of continuing challenging circumstances in Venezuela, including its unstable environment and heightened unrest that have led to a sustained lack of demand, and our expectation that these circumstances will continue for the foreseeable future, 3M has concluded that it no longer meets the criteria of control to continue consolidating its Venezuelan operations, and therefore deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiary as of May 31, 2019. 3M notified relevant employees today that it has suspended local operations of this subsidiary for the foreseeable future.
 
The deconsolidation results in a pre-tax charge of approximately $160 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2019. This charge was not part of the “2019 Updated Outlook” for full-year earnings expectations projected in the Company’s first quarter earnings release dated April 25, 2019. While reporting GAAP-basis results, 3M also expects to provide certain non-GAAP income and earnings per share measures that will exclude the charge associated with this deconsolidation.
 
There is no economic impact to 3M from the deconsolidation of the subsidiary. The operations were immaterial to 3M’s overall operations. The charge is non-cash and primarily relates to foreign currency translation losses previously included in accumulated other comprehensive losses associated with foreign currency movements before Venezuela was accounted for as a highly inflationary economy.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report contains forward-looking information about 3M’s financial results and estimates and business prospects that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “aim,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “target,” “forecast” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans or prospects. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: (1) worldwide economic, political, regulatory, capital markets and other external conditions and other factors beyond the Company’s control, including natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; (2) the Company’s credit ratings and its cost of capital; (3) competitive conditions and customer preferences; (4) foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; (5) the timing and market acceptance of new product offerings; (6) the availability and cost of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) due to shortages, increased demand or supply interruptions (including those caused by natural and other disasters and other events); (7) the impact of acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring; (8) operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated; (9) unanticipated problems or delays with the phased implementation of a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, or security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology infrastructure; (10) financial market risks that may affect the Company’s funding obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement plans; and (11) legal proceedings, including significant developments that could occur in the legal and regulatory proceedings described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2018, and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (the “Reports”). Changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results. A further description of these factors is located in the Reports under “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Items 1 and 1A (Annual Report) and in Part I, Item 2 and Part II, Item 1A (Quarterly Reports).
