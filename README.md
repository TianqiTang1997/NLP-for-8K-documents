## Steps
1. Download 8K documents from today's S&P 500 companies for the past 5 years.
2. Extract the useful text from the html documents.
3. Pre-process text.
  1. do series of transformations from the paper (Xiu)
  2. do a couple extra text cleaning steps.

## Implement from paper
I replicated the paper. Need data to estimate on. Also, need a strategy to use this sentiment factor.
